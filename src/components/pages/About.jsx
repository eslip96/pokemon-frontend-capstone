          Sugimori, first introduced in 1996 by Nintendo, Game Freak, and

          each other for sport. The franchise includes video games, trading card
          games, animated television series, movies, toys, and more. Players
          typically assume the role of a Pokemon Trainer, embarking on a journey

          the eight Gym Leaders, and challenging the Elite Four. The franchise's
          core themes revolve around friendship, teamwork, and the pursuit of
          personal growth and excellence.
